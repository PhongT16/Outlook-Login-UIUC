Command to build the image:
docker build -t duo-image:latest . 

Command to run the image w/o mounting:
docker run -d --name duo-container duo-image tail -f /dev/null

Command to run the image w/ mounting:
docker run -d --name duo-container -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/mount-src",target=/duo_auth/app duo-image tail -f /dev/null


The -it instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin; 
creating an interactive bash shell in the container

Command to use bash in the container 
docker exec -it duo-container bash 
Question: If I have the -it option in the docker run and docker exec commands, it works.
If I take out the -it option from the docker run command, and I run the docker exec command, it still works. 
So do I really need to have the -it in the docker run command?

To start an existing container which is stopped
docker start <container-name/ID>
To stop a running container
docker stop <container-name/ID>
Then to login to the interactive shell of a container
docker exec -it <container-name/ID> bash
